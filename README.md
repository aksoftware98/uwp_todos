# UWP To-Dos 
In the hype of Single Page Applications (SPAs) with the technologies like ReactJS, Angular and Blazor, all the world is going towards the Web, that's great but on the other hand we losing the power of native apps like (UWP for Windows 10), as a Windows fan and .NET addicts, I'm in Love with UWP and from my point of view, it's the most powerful and out of the box SDK I have ever seen, the only place that you can find new things in the world of programming and among other framework, after two years, I have decided to make this demo to compare it with Blazor and Single Page Application to show the power of the native apps. 

## What is UWP To-Dos
It's a demo cloud app built with UWP as the client-side and ASP.NET Core API as the back-end and using Azure to host the solution and leverging some services like Azure Storage and Azure Cosmos DB which as a NoSQL Globally Distributed Database, so this demo teaches you all the new technologies you need to develop an advanced business apps starting from a simple idea.

## App Features 
One of the most important thing in the business apps is the reporting so the owners of the business or the decision makers could be guided to the next step in their business based on the reports and chart that software provides for them, and from that point I have developed this simple solution and added a new aspect to the world of To-Dos app which is the measuring of each task, the concept known as (Points).
With **points** feature the user is able to manage his day based on points so the app could now gives reports based on the user achievements within the day and see charts just like business app, so the user can manage his/her day with more control over the progress and enhancement for the next day
